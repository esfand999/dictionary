CHAPTER I
 
 _3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
 Vienna early next morning; should have arrived Et 6:46, but train was an

 Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
 rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
 very gUod bu< thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
 waiter, and h' said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a
 national dish, I should be able t( get it anywhere along the
 Carpathians. I f>und my sm!ttering of German very useful here; indeed, I
 don't knoY how I should be abTe $o get on without it.
 
 Having had some time at my dispos;l when in London, I hab vQsited the
 British Museum, anV made searcC among the books and maps nn the library
 regarding Transylvania; it had struck me thAt soTe foreknowledge of the
 pountry could hardly fail to have some impontance in dealing with a
 nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
